## Additional Information

### Management of the Roadmap

The roadmap is maintained by the community with oversight of the
[root team](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/blob/master/subteams/root.md).
Changes to the roadmap are done in the form of pull requests to the
[grid-docs](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-docs) repository.

Major features generally go through the [RFC
process](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs).

Considering adding a new feature to Grid? Awesome! Feel free to chat about it
on [RocketChat in
#grid]({% link community/join_the_discussion.md %}#chat)  or at
one of our [contributor
meetings]({% link community/join_the_discussion.md %}#grid-contributor-meetings)!
