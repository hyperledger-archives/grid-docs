Hyperledger hosts a Grid chat channel and a mailing list. These tools require a
free [Linux Foundation ID](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org). The Grid project
also hosts events for key milestones, with invites through our chatroom and mailing list.

## Chat

[The #grid channel](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid) is the place to
go for up-to-the-minute Hyperledger Grid discussions, from quick help to
involved conversations.

## Mailing List

[The Hyperledger Grid mailing list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/grid)
provides a forum for project announcements, simple questions, more complex discussions.
