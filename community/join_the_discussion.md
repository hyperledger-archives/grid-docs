Hyperledger hosts a Grid chat channel and a mailing list. These tools require a
free [Linux Foundation ID](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org).
The Grid project also hosts events for key milestones, 
with invites through our chatroom and mailing list.

## Chat

[The #grid channel](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid) is the place to
go for up-to-the-minute Hyperledger Grid discussions, 
from quick help to involved conversations.

## Mailing List

[The Hyperledger Grid mailing list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/grid)
provides a forum for project announcements, 
simple questions and more complex discussions.
