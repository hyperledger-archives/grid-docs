Hyperledger Grid is a platform for building supply chain solutions that include
distributed ledger components. This project provides a set of modular components
for developing smart contracts and client interfaces, including domain-specific
data models (such as GS1 product definitions), smart-contract business logic,
libraries, and SDKs.

**Project status:**
Hyperledger Grid is currently in the
[incubation](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Project+Lifecycle#ProjectLifecycle-incubation)
stage of the Hyperledger product lifecycle. The [Hyperledger Grid
proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b6ES0bKUK30E2iZizy3vjVEhPn7IvsW5buDo7nFXBE0/)
was accepted in December, 2018.
